# yelu-language
Yelu language is a conlag used in my roleplaying worlds.
It has a semitic style of grammar and each consonant has a elemental meaning.
This repository has tools like a dictionary, word root analyzer or a grammar guide.

Dependendies:
- For the Dictionary: Python 3
- The Basic Guide is written in html. You need XXX for the "convert_to_pdf" script.
